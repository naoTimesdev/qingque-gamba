## Credits
- Original Mihomo API implementation: https://github.com/kT-Yeh/mihomo/ (Yoinked most of the code and rewrite it using `msgspec`)
- StarDB.gg: https://stardb.gg/ (I basically ripped their design styles and decide to reimplement it and tweaks)
  - Some difference are:
    - Relic set bonus information
    - Show avatar
    - More iconography
    - Better skills view (Show major trace, alignment issue, etc.)
    - Fixed a ton of centering issue
    - Better information for Element/Path
    - Add rarity star
    - Margin adjustment
    - Use font that are used in-game
- Mar-7th StarRailRes: https://github.com/Mar-7th/StarRailRes (I'm using assets from here and saved it locally.)
- thesadru genshin.py: https://github.com/thesadru/genshin.py (Used some of their code for my own HoyoLab client.)
